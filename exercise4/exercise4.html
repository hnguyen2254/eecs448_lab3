        <p id="para">One day Ringo the dog went out to go buy food for his family.
            When he was purchasing the food, he realized he had to run a mile back to his 
            house because he forgot to bring money. On the way there, he realized that
            his wallet was in his back pocket. So he had to walk all the way back to the 
            grocery store. He was very frustrated. But he was glad that he could buy dog food 
            for his pups. Ringo comes from a line of small yorkies. He is very spoiled so he likes
            spoil his own pups too. Ringo loves to eat meat especially things like chicken and beef.
            Ringo and his children love their doggy toys, and they do not like to share them. 
            Ringo and his pups love to go on walks and run around. There is one thing that 
            Ringo cannot stand. He hates when people try to take his toys or mess with his 
            kennel. He is very protective and will stand up to anyone even though he is a 
            tiny sized dog. His bark is loud and hit bite is even bigger. The END....</p>
